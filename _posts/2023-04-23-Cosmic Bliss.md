In the surprising heat of the Canadian mid-spring, are you looking to cool off? Look no further than Cosmic Bliss Ice Cream. 

Cosmic Bliss, rebranded after 12 years of being sold as "Coconut Bliss", is wowing both the GTA and our tastebuds. Their newest innovation is 
their Grass-Fed Dairy flavors. Since transitioning to dairy, they have remained a "plant-based and planet-biased" company. This philosophy is certainly hard to ignore, 
as removing the lid from each ice cream tub
reveals an earth-styled wrapper. Here at FillUpGTA, we love that "global equity and sustainable farming" are at the heart of their philosophy and product offerings.

Coconut Bliss began in Oregon, USA, selling "thrift shop" ice cream.

Their brand new dairy-based favors include "All the Good Things", which includes caramel, fudge, and chocolate. We think this title sounds quite accurate. Also appearing
are the revamped flavors of Twisted Cookie Dough, Peanut Butter Blitz, Hazelnut Fudge, Strawberry Lemon Shortbread, Banana Caramel Flamb√©, Chocolate Euphoria, and Vanilla Bean
Nirvana. 

Their coconut flavors also pack a nutty punch of excitement. Chocolate Peanut Butter offers "secret pockets of salty-smooth peanut butter"; although we found that the peanut
butter was quite prominent in their ice cream, almost making up as much of the tub as ice cream itself (this is not necessarily a bad thing). Sea Salt Caramel Chocolate, Chocolate Hazelnut
Decadence, Chocolate Walnut Brownie, Mint Chip Galactica, Golden Banana Brownie Swirl, the appropriately named "INFINITE COCONUT!", Dark Chocolate, Madagascan Vanilla Bean, and Sweet Cherry Amoretta top off Cosmic Bliss' stunning mouthful of flavors, the length of which we have not seen in many other ice cream companies' offerings.

Beyond their various names, Cosmic Bliss' ice cream tubs offer real nutritional value; one serving of our test flavor, Sea Salt Chocolate, offers potassium, iron, and calcium.
While Vitamin D would be a welcome addition to a coconut-based ice cream, we don't mind that it's not present. We are confident that you'll find enough Vitamin D-liciousnes
in every bite to compensate.
